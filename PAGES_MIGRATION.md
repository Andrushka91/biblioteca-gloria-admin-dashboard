# Pages Structure Migration

## What was done:

### 1. **Created `old-pages` directory**

- All original pages content was copied to `src/app/old-pages/`
- Modified the components and modules to use `OldPages` prefix to avoid conflicts
- Added routing at `/old-pages` path (requires authentication)

### 2. **Cleaned up `pages` directory**

- Removed all old page components (charts, e-commerce, forms, etc.)
- Kept only `dashboard` and `miscellaneous` (for 404 page)
- Created a new minimal dashboard component

### 3. **Updated routing**

- **Main routes** (`app-routing.module.ts`):

  - `/pages` - Your new clean pages (requires auth)
  - `/old-pages` - All original pages (requires auth)
  - `/miscellaneous/404` - 404 page (no auth required)
  - `**` - Wildcard redirects to 404

- **New pages structure** (`pages/pages-routing.module.ts`):
  - `/pages/dashboard` - New simple dashboard
  - `/pages/miscellaneous/404` - 404 page

## Access URLs:

### New Clean Structure:

- `/pages/dashboard` - Your new dashboard
- `/pages/miscellaneous/404` - 404 page

### Old Pages (Preserved):

- `/old-pages/dashboard` - Original e-commerce dashboard
- `/old-pages/iot-dashboard` - Original IoT dashboard
- `/old-pages/forms` - All original forms
- `/old-pages/tables` - All original tables
- `/old-pages/charts` - All original charts
- `/old-pages/ui-features` - All UI components
- And all other original routes...

## Next Steps:

1. **Add your new pages** to `src/app/pages/`
2. **Update menu** in `src/app/pages/pages-menu.ts`
3. **Reference old components** from `src/app/old-pages/` when needed
4. **Eventually migrate** useful components from old-pages to your new structure

## Notes:

- All old functionality is preserved and accessible
- 404 handling works for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- The authentication system remains unchanged
- You can gradually migrate components from old-pages as needed
